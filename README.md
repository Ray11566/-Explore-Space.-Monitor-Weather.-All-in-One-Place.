🚀 Explore Space. Monitor Weather. All in One Place.is an interactive 3D web application combining space exploration with real-time weather data. Built with **Three.js**, it features a navigable solar system where users can explore detailed planets before transitioning to Earth.
The experience centers on a **rotating 3D Earth globe** with clickable markers. Selecting India opens a comprehensive weather dashboard powered by **OpenWeatherMap API**, displaying live conditions for 50+ Indian cities. The interface shows temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and visibility through intuitive visualizations.
Using **Leaflet.js** for mapping, users can toggle weather layers (temperature, clouds, precipitation, wind) and receive **smart alerts** with practical advice. Designed with a space-themed dark aesthetic, it's fully responsive across devices.
This project serves as both an **educational astronomy tool** and a **functional weather monitoring system**, demonstrating modern web development with WebGL, APIs, and interactive visualization techniques.
